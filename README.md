## Description
This is the movie app where you can search for the movies and save them to Watch Later list or add them to your Favorites!

## API
We used the https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api for getting all the movies, so BIG THANKS to them!

## Favorites
If you want to add a movie to Favorites, you can do it at the right icon at the top of the movie. To view all your favorite movies just click the button on the right of the searchbar. You can remove the movie from the favorites by clicking the favorite button again.

## We got your back
Don't worry about signing up and all the boring things like that, we are saving your Watch Later and Favorites inside the browsers, so you can access them anytime from the same browser!
